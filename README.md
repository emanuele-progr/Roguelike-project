# Roguelike-project

- **Academic Year**: 2020-2021
- **Project Title**: An open source roguelike game for PCs and mobile devices.
- **Student**: Marioemanuele Ghianni
- **CFUs**: 9 

In this project i will implement a 2D roguelike game mainly using Unity and C# programming.  
  
Next, I will deal with refining the interface, menus and various screens paying particular attention to human interaction, visual and audio feedbacks and making the use of the application as pleasant as possible according to my possibilities.   
Finally, I plan to publish the application and have it tested by various people to collect feedbacks both manually and automatically through some tools (Usability Testing). 

# Installation / How to play
Simply import the project to Unity and build for the desired platform OR play in browser [here](https://ema-tko.itch.io/thestarvinggame).

# Tools and Techniques

The main tools and techniques are:
- **Unity 2020.3.0f1**: for the game development.
- **Visual Studio 2019**: for C# scripting
- **Unity Analytics**: for post release data collection.


# Expected Outcomes

We expect the following outcomes from this project:
- A fully functional game. :heavy_check_mark:
- An integration with mobile devices and touch controls. :heavy_check_mark:
- A series of usability tests. :heavy_check_mark:
- A open source release on Github and/or in play store/itch.io . :heavy_check_mark:
- A good environment to test Deep reinforcement learning algorithms. :heavy_check_mark:



# Summary
The purpose of this project is to experiment with the development of an entertainment product strongly based on human-computer interaction.   
The goal is therefore to create a simple videogame application but above all an intuitive application, immediate and pleasant to use on various devices.
