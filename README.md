# Roguelike-project

- **Academic Year**: 2020-2021
- **Project Title**: An open source roguelike game for PCs and mobile devices.
- **Student**: Marioemanuele Ghianni
- **CFUs**: 9 

In this project i will implement a 2D roguelike game mainly using Unity and C# programming. 
Functionally completed the game, the focus will be on creating a script that immediately exposes game's data in order to easily integrate machine learning(RL) algorithms to improve the enemy AI (see Deep-Crawl project). 
Next, I will deal with refining the interface, menus and various screens paying particular attention to human interaction, visual feedbacks and making the use of the application as pleasant as possible according to my possibilities. 
Finally, I plan to publish the application and have it tested by various people to collect feedbacks both manually and automatically through some tools (Usability Testing).

# Tools and Techniques

The main tools and techniques i will employ are:
- **Unity**: for the game development \[2\].
- **Unity Analytics**: for post release data collection \[3\].

# Expected Outcomes
*Here you should itemize the specific project outcomes.*

We expect the following outcomes from this project:
- A fully functional game.
- A good environment to test Deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
- An integration with mobile devices and touch controls.
- A series of usability tests.
- A open source release on Github and/or in play store/itch.io . 



# Summary
The purpose of this project is to experiment with cross-device interaction and determine how feasible it can be in practice. Our goal is to consider implementation strategies and experiment with at least one use-case scenario. If successful, the prototype software components developed in this project could foster cross-device interaction in real application in the future.
